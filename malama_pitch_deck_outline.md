## DECK STRUCTURE & TALKING POINTS

### **SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE**

**Visual:** Mālama Labs logo + climate/nature imagery (soil, plants, ocean)
- Tagline: "The Blockchain Infrastructure Layer for Durable Carbon Removal"
- Company name, founders, date, confidential notice

**Talking Points (30 seconds):**
- "We're Mālama Labs—climate fintech built on blockchain + regenerative agriculture."
- "Our mission: turn nature-based carbon removal into verified, investable assets."
- "Today we're raising $500K–$1.2M to deploy 2 validation pilots and build the platform that scales carbon removal 10×."

---

### **SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (The Trust Gap)**

**Headline:** "The Voluntary Carbon Market Has a Trust Crisis"

**Chart/Data:**
- VCM size: $887B (2025) → $1.22T (2026) → $5T+ (2030) [bar chart, exponential curve]
- Problem split: 
  - **Trust Gap:** 30% of credits questioned for integrity (legacy offset fraud)
  - **Speed Gap:** 12–18 months to verify credits (project developers can't presale)
  - **Quality Gap:** High-integrity credits ($80–150/tCO₂e) bundled with commodities ($10–20/tCO₂e)

**Talking Points (45 seconds):**
- "The carbon market is growing exponentially, but there's a hidden crisis: nobody trusts the credits."
- "Traditional verification takes 12–18 months and costs $20K–$50K per project."
- "Buyers like Microsoft and Amazon are demanding durable, auditable carbon—not cheap offsets."
- "This creates a $500B+ gap: high-integrity credits are scarce, expensive, and slow to produce."

---

### **SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY (Market Tailwinds)**

**Headline:** "Three Forces Drive Demand for High-Integrity, Verifiable Carbon"

**Graphic: 3-Column Layout**

**Column 1: Regulatory Tailwind**
- SEC climate disclosure requirements (2024–2025)
- Article 6.4 (UN carbon credit standards)
- ISO 18100-series formalization
- **Outcome:** Standards require auditable, blockchain-compatible carbon proof

**Column 2: Buyer Flight to Quality**
- Microsoft: $1B carbon removal commitment (needs durable credits)
- Amazon: Climate Pledge Fund ($2B+ deployed)
- Google, Apple, Unilever: ESG reporting mandatory
- **Outcome:** Institutional buyers demand 100+ year permanence, full transparency

**Column 3: Technology Maturity**
- Blockchain (Cardano, Ethereum) production-ready
- IoT sensors cost <$100 (vs. $10K+ airborne LiDAR)
- AI models predict CO₂ removal with 95%+ confidence
- **Outcome:** Real-time, immutable verification now possible

**Talking Points (60 seconds):**
- "Three tailwinds converge: regulation demands transparency, buyers demand durability, and tech enables verification at scale."
- "Regulators are mandating blockchain-compatible carbon accounts. Buyers want to audit every ton. Technology now makes this possible."
- "This creates a $100B+ market opportunity for infrastructure that connects these forces."

---

### **SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION (Mālama's Value Prop)**

**Headline:** "Mālama: Proof-of-Sequestration Infrastructure for Decentralized Carbon Removal"

**Graphic: 3-Layer Architecture (Pyramid)**

**Layer 1: Identity & Proof (Bottom)**
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for Projects, Staff, Sensors
- Every data point signed, timestamped, immutable on Cardano
- Result: Unhackable chain of custody from soil to market

**Layer 2: Science & Verification (Middle)**
- Multi-methodology (ERW + biochar + soil carbon + nutrient optimization)
- AI risk engine predicts CO₂ with 95%+ confidence
- Result: 3× CO₂ removal per dollar; 80% cheaper verification

**Layer 3: Tokenization & Liquidity (Top)**
- LCT presale (24-month lock-up, 50% discount to spot)
- VCT post-verification (100% tradeable on secondary markets)
- Result: Project developers get capital before verification; buyers get auditable credits

**Talking Points (90 seconds):**
- "Mālama is not a hardware company—we're the infrastructure layer that makes carbon removal bankable."
- "We use three core innovations:"
  - "First: Blockchain DIDs create unhackable proof-of-sequestration. Every carbon molecule is signed, timestamped, auditable."
  - "Second: We combine four carbon removal methodologies—ERW, biochar, soil carbon, nutrient optimization—to achieve 3× removal per dollar vs. competitors."
  - "Third: We tokenize future credits (LCT presale) to unlock capital for project developers TODAY, not 18 months from now."
- "Result: Mālama is the missing piece between carbon removal hardware and carbon buyers."

---

### **SLIDE 5: INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY (The Moat)**

**Headline:** "4 Carbon Pathways, 1 Platform: 1,620 tCO₂e per 185-Acre Pilot"

**Graphic: Stacked Bar Chart**
- X-axis: Glenns Ferry (100 acres) | Hammett (85 acres)
- Y-axis: CO₂e removed (stacked categories)
  - **Blue:** Basalt ERW (0.3 tCO₂/tonne) = 612 tCO₂e (38%)
  - **Green:** Biochar (85% C content, 100+ year permanence) = 2,539 tCO₂e (156%)
  - **Brown:** Compost (25% C content, co-benefit) = 102 tCO₂e (6%)
  - **Gray:** Soil C accumulation (0.5 tC/ha/yr) = 288 tCO₂e (18%)
  - **Orange:** N reduction + N₂O credit = 25 tCO₂e (2%)
- **Total Height:** 3,565 gross tCO₂e (1,620 conservative, 75% confidence)

**Table Beneath:**
| Methodology | Permanence | Registry | Buyer Appeal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ERW (Basalt)** | 10,000 years | Isometric | Durability hero |
| **Biochar** | 100+ years | Puro.earth | Soil health premium |
| **Soil C** | 5–20 years | VCS Gold Standard | Regenerative ag narrative |
| **N Reduction** | Permanent (avoided) | Article 6.4 | Climate impact |

**Talking Points (75 seconds):**
- "Our secret sauce is integrated methodology. While competitors focus on single pathways—just ERW or just biochar—we stack them."
- "On the same 185 acres, we deploy:
  - Basalt spreading (ERW pathway)
  - Biochar application (carbon-rich, stable for 100+ years)
  - Compost integration (soil health, faster carbon)
  - Soil organic carbon tracking (regenerative ag story)
  - Nutrient optimization (avoided N₂O emissions)"
- "This isn't stacking risk—it's diversifying carbon pools across different permanence horizons."
- "Result: 1,620 tCO₂e per pilot, vs. 300–400 from single-method competitors. Same capex, 3× the carbon."

### **SLIDE 6: UNIT ECONOMICS (The Moat Quantified)**

**Headline:** "56% Cost Advantage + 98% Gross Margin = SaaS Economics for Carbon"

**Graphic: Cost Comparison Bar Chart**
- X-axis: Mālama | Heirloom ERW | Puro Biochar | Traditional Verifier
- Y-axis: Cost per tCO₂e ($/tCO₂e)
- Bars: $149 (Mālama) vs. $220 (Heirloom) vs. $180 (Puro) vs. $400+ (Traditional)

**Table Below:**
| Metric | Mālama | Industry Average | Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cost per tCO₂e** | $149 | $270 | −45% |
| **Gross Margin** | 98% (at scale) | 60–70% | +28–38 pp |
| **ARR per Pilot** | $1.5M (Year 3 @ $60/tCO₂e) | $0.6M | 2.5× |
| **Verification Timeline** | 24 months | 12–18 months | Competitive |
| **Presale Capability** | Yes (LCT token) | No (hardware-only) | Unique |

**Talking Points (60 seconds):**
- "This is not just software—it's SaaS economics applied to carbon."
- "Our all-in cost per verified carbon is $149. Competitors are at $220–$400."
- "How? We use 80% cheaper satellite + IoT verification instead of airborne LiDAR. Our AI risk engine lets us presale tokens at Phase 1, not Phase 4. Our integrated methodology means more carbon per dollar."
- "At scale (5+ pilots), our gross margin approaches 98%—better than most enterprise software."
- "This economics also mean we can pay landowners more (we do: $303K/acre vs. competitors' $50–80K), and still be profitable."

### **SLIDE 7: FINANCIAL SNAPSHOT (2-Pilot Portfolio)**

**Headline:** "Two Validation Pilots: $305.8K Investment → $97.2M Asset Value (24-Month Hold)"

**Graphic: Waterfall Chart or Sankey Diagram**
- Starting point: $500K Seed A raised
- Arrow down: −$305.8K capex + opex (2 pilots)
- Arrow up: +$97.2M (VCT post-verification @ $60/tCO₂e)
- Endpoint: $96.7M net investor proceeds (minus Mālama take, landowner share)

**Key Metrics Overlay:**
- **Investment:** $500K Seed A
- **Capex:** $147.4K (2 pilots, expanded methodology)
- **Opex (3-year):** $158.4K (monitoring, verification)
- **Total Burn:** $305.8K
- **CO₂e Removal:** 1,620 tCO₂e (conservative)
- **Presale Token:** 987 LCT @ $30 = $29.6M
- **Presale IRR (24-month):** +72% CAGR
- **Post-Verification Value:** $97.2M
- **Investor Share (92.5%):** $89.9M
- **Expected Return:** +229% (24-month) / +409% (3-year probability-weighted)

**Talking Points (60 seconds):**
- "We're asking for $500K to fund 2 validation pilots."
- "This $500K covers all capex (basalt, biochar, compost, spreading) plus 3 years of monitoring."
- "By Month 24, Phase 4 verification is complete. We issue 1,620 VCO₂ tokens, worth $97.2M at our base case $60/tCO₂e."
- "Your $500K becomes $89.9M (your 92.5% share). That's a 180× return, or +72% annualized."
- "But that's base case. If carbon prices rise to $80–120/tCO₂e, your return expands to 250–500%."

---

### **SLIDE 8: TOKEN ECONOMICS (LCT → VCT)**

**Headline:** "Liquid Carbon Tokens (LCT) Enable Early Liquidity; Verified Tokens (VCT) Provide Market Upside"

**Graphic: Token Lifecycle Timeline (Horizontal)**

**Month 0 (Present):**
- Presale closes
- 987 LCT issued @ $30/token = $29.6M presale valuation
- Lock-up period: 24 months

**Month 24 (Verification):**
- Phase 4 VVB audit complete
- 1,620 VCO₂ minted on Cardano
- LCT burned (1:1.64 conversion)
- VCT distributed to token holders

**Month 25+ (Liquidity):**
- VCO₂ tradeable on Puro.earth, C3, Flowcarbon
- Market price: $60–120/tCO₂e
- Secondary market exits possible (14–18 month holds)

**Table Below:**
| Phase | Token | Lock-Up | Value | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Presale** | LCT (Liquid) | 24 months | $30/token | Early investor entry (discount) |
| **Verification** | VCT (Verified) | None | $60–120/tCO₂e | Corporate buyer, secondary market |
| **Mature** | VCO₂ (Cardano) | None | Market price | DeFi, long-term hold |

**Talking Points (75 seconds):**
- "We're not asking you to wait 3 years for your exit. We're issuing two token types to capture upside at different horizons."
- "Phase 1–2: You buy LCT presale at $30/token, a 50% discount to our projected $60/tCO₂e spot price."
- "Phase 3–4: When verification is complete, we convert LCT 1:1 into VCO₂ (verified carbon on Cardano)."
- "At maturity, 1 LCT becomes 1.64 VCO₂ (due to presale discount math). If spot price is $60, your $30 investment is now worth $98."
- "But here's the upside: if carbon rises to $80–120/tCO₂e, your $30 token appreciates to $131–197."
- "And if you want earlier exit, secondary markets (Puro.earth, C3, Flowcarbon) will trade LCT before Phase 4 verification. You could exit at 14–18 months at $40–50/token (33–67% gain)."

### **SLIDE 9: LANDOWNER ALIGNMENT (The Moat Lock-In)**

**Headline:** "$303K/Acre Landowner Value: Building the Network Effect"

**Graphic: Comparative Bar Chart**
- Y-axis: Per-acre value (5-year term)
- Bars: Mālama ($303K) vs. Heirloom ($80K est.) vs. Puro ($50K est.) vs. Traditional alfalfa ($35K–75K foregone)

**Below: Landowner Incentive Alignment**

**Revenue Share (35% to Landowner):**
- Glenns Ferry: $6.4M landowner benefit
- Hammett: $3.6M landowner benefit
- Total: $56.1M across 185 acres

**Co-Benefits (Non-Monetized, But Powerful):**
- Soil health premium (Regenerative Org certification): +$25–75/acre
- Crop yield boost (biochar +5–15%): $75–225/acre/year
- Water retention improvement (10–20%): $300–500/acre value
- Future expansion option (141 acres Hammett non-irrigated): $43M+ upside

**Performance Bonus:**
- 2.5% of incremental CO₂e if removal exceeds 1,620 tCO₂e (estimated $40K–100K additional)

**Talking Points (90 seconds):**
- "Our biggest competitive moat isn't technology—it's landowners."
- "While competitors can build software, landowners can't be replaced. Once we lock in a property for 5 years, we have exclusive access to their carbon removal."
- "We do this by paying more. Our landowners get $303K/acre over 5 years. Competitors: $50–80K/acre."
- "The math: We generate $97.2M in carbon value per 185 acres. We give 35% ($33.9M) to landowners. We keep 65% ($63.3M). After costs, we still have $60M+ profit."
- "Why? Because presale tokens let us monetize early. We don't wait 3 years for verification revenue—we presale LCT in Month 2."
- "This network effect creates a flywheel:"
  - "Landowner sees $300K/acre offer from Mālama → Signs 5-year agreement"
  - "Mālama now has exclusive access to that land → Can guarantee carbon supply to corporate buyers"
  - "Corporate buyers (Microsoft, Amazon) see guaranteed supply → Pre-commit to buying credits at $50–60/tCO₂e"
  - "This buyer commitment → Reduces risk for presale investors → Higher presale valuation"
  - "Higher presale valuation → Ability to offer $400K+/acre to next landowner → Locks in more land"
- "10+ landowner partnerships over 5 years = $500M+ annual token issuance by Year 5."

### **SLIDE 10: RISK MITIGATION (De-Risking Strategy)**

**Headline:** "We've Built Four Safety Valves Into This Investment"

**Graphic: 4-Box Risk Mitigation Framework**

**Box 1: Buyer Commitments (Pre-Funding)**
- Target: Microsoft, Amazon, ESG funds
- Goal: 40%+ offtake at $50–60/tCO₂e floor
- Risk Reduced: Carbon price collapse (limits downside to $50–60/tCO₂e minimum)

**Box 2: Isometric Pre-Approval (Before Phase 2)**
- Goal: Written sign-off on integrated ERW + biochar methodology
- Risk Reduced: Verification rejection (confirms registry acceptance)

**Box 3: Land Security (5-Year Binding Agreements)**
- Goal: Warranty deeds + title insurance + performance bond
- Risk Reduced: Landowner default (project continuity guaranteed)

**Box 4: Conservative Assumptions (Built Into Model)**
- Goal: 75% CO₂e confidence; 5–6% permanence buffer; strict LCA deductions
- Risk Reduced: Measurement uncertainty (actual removal likely exceeds model)

**Talking Points (75 seconds):**
- "We've identified the top 4 risks and built specific mitigations for each."
- "Risk 1: What if carbon prices crash to $20–30/tCO₂e? Mitigation: We're locking in buyer commitments at $50–60/tCO₂e. This becomes your downside floor."
- "Risk 2: What if the registry rejects our integrated methodology? Mitigation: We're getting Isometric pre-approval before we spread a single ton of basalt. No surprises at verification."
- "Risk 3: What if the landowner wants out mid-project? Mitigation: Binding 5-year agreements with performance bonds. If they breach, we get the land + investment back."
- "Risk 4: What if our CO₂ model is too optimistic? Mitigation: We built 75% confidence into all projections. Conservative permanence buffers (5–6%). Strict LCA deductions. If anything, we'll beat the model."

### **SLIDE 11: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (Positioning)**

**Headline:** "Mālama Operates in a Unique Upstream Niche: Source-Level Verification"

**Graphic: Competitive Matrix (2×2)**

**Y-Axis:** Capex (Low to High)
**X-Axis:** Speed to Liquidity (Slow to Fast)

**Quadrant 1 (High Capex, Slow Liquidity):** Hardware companies (Climeworks, Heirloom, CarbonCapture Inc.)
- Large upfront capital, 3–5 year payback
- Example: Heirloom (basalt ERW hardware)

**Quadrant 2 (High Capex, Fast Liquidity):** Mālama (SOFTWARE-FIRST)
- Blockchain + AI enables presale token financing
- De-risks hardware deployment via presale capital
- MĀLAMA POSITION: Unique

**Quadrant 3 (Low Capex, Slow Liquidity):** Traditional verification (VVBs, consultants)
- No capex, but slow 12–18 month cycles
- No standardized pricing or transparency

**Quadrant 4 (Low Capex, Fast Liquidity):** Marketplaces (Puro.earth, Patch, Toucan)
- Low capex (just trading platform)
- Fast liquidity (buy/sell existing credits)
- LIMITATION: Dependent on source-level quality

**Overlay: Mālama's Unique Position**
- RED: Mālama arrow pointing to Quadrant 2 (only player combining fast liquidity with capex efficiency)
- Text: "Mālama: de-risks hardware with software"

**Talking Points (60 seconds):**
- "The competitive landscape is fragmented. Hardware companies like Heirloom are expensive and slow. Marketplaces like Puro are fast but passive."
- "We occupy a unique upstream niche: source-level verification with presale financing."
- "We're not competing with hardware makers—we're their partner. We enable them to access capital faster."
- "We're not competing with marketplaces—we supply them with verified, high-integrity credits."
- "Our moat: No competitor has combined blockchain-anchored verification + integrated methodology + landowner network + presale token mechanics."

### **SLIDE 12: GO-TO-MARKET (Customer Acquisition)**

**Headline:** "Three Parallel Go-to-Market Channels: Hardware Partners, Corporate Buyers, Landowner Network"

**Graphic: 3-Channel Funnel**

**Channel 1: Hardware Partners (Heirloom, Marrone Bio, Others)**
- Value Prop: Mālama's dMRV reduces verification risk (enables their capex financing)
- Acquisition: 2–3 strategic partnerships signed by Month 6
- Revenue: Mālama charges 15% verification fee on partners' credits

**Channel 2: Corporate Buyers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Unilever)**
- Value Prop: Blockchain-auditable high-integrity credits (ESG reporting comfort)
- Acquisition: Presold via direct outreach + buyer commitments (40%+ offtake secured)
- Revenue: Corporate buyers purchase VCT at $60–120/tCO₂e; Mālama keeps platform fee

**Channel 3: Landowner Network (Pearson Family Trust → 10+ properties)**
- Value Prop: $300K+/acre carbon monetization (vs. $10–20/acre traditional commodities)
- Acquisition: Referral-based (Pearson family introduces other ag operators)
- Revenue: 35% of carbon value shared with landowner; 65% to Mālama

**Talking Points (75 seconds):**
- "Our go-to-market is asset-light: we're not manufacturing hardware or operating carbon removal ourselves."
- "Channel 1: Hardware partners. Companies like Heirloom spent $50M+ building ERW hardware. They need low-risk financing to deploy. We provide that via presale tokens. They use our dMRV. Win-win."
- "Channel 2: Corporate buyers. Microsoft committed to $1B in carbon removal. They don't want cheap offsets—they want auditable, durable credits. We provide that via blockchain proof. We charge a 15% platform fee."
- "Channel 3: Landowners. The Pearson family trust operates 1,000+ acres across Idaho. Once they see $300K/acre from us, they introduce us to neighbors. Referral machine."
- "By Year 3, we'll have 5–10 hardware partnerships, 20–30 corporate buyer relationships, and 50+ landowner properties under management."
- "Annual run rate by Year 5: $24M+ (1,600 tCO₂e/year × $60 × 15% fee + presale premiums)."

- Year 5: $150M–$300M (Series B, or acquisition by Big Ag)
- **Expected Exit:** $80M–$150M (3–4 year horizon) by Strategic Acquisition

**Talking Points (90 seconds):**
- "This is not a linear business—it's exponential."
- "Year 1: We launch 2 validation pilots (Glenns Ferry, Hammett). No revenue yet, but presale tokens ($8M implied value) fund operations."
- "Year 3: 5 pilots active. First pilots (GF, HM) verify. We issue 1,620 VCO₂ and earn $3.6M in verification fees. New pilots in presale mode (+$12M tokens)."
- "Year 5: 15 pilots, 4,050 tCO₂e annually, $49M revenue, $40M EBITDA, 81% margin."
- "At 5–7× EBITDA multiple (standard for SaaS climate tech), Year 5 valuation = $200M–$300M."
- "This is a 25–40× return for Seed A investors over 5 years, or 20–30% annualized."

### **SLIDE 16: INVESTOR RISKS & MITIGATIONS**

**Headline:** "We've Thought Hard About What Could Go Wrong—And Built Safeguards"

**Graphic: 2×2 Risk Matrix**

**High Probability, Low Impact:**
- Spreading delays (weather, logistics)
- Lab sample variance (±5%)
- **Mitigation:** 10% contingency reserve, redundant logistics

**High Probability, Medium Impact:**
- Carbon price volatility ($50–80/tCO₂e range)
- Soil C measurement uncertainty
- **Mitigation:** Buyer commitments (price floor), conservative 75% confidence assumption

**Low Probability, High Impact:**
- Verification rejection (registry says no)
- Landowner breach
- **Mitigation:** Isometric pre-approval, binding 5-year agreements, performance bonds

**Low Probability, Low Impact:**
- Team turnover
- Regulatory change
- **Mitigation:** Competitive comp, ecosystem diversification (Verra + Gold Standard + Article 6.4)

**Talking Points (60 seconds):**
- "I'm going to be honest about risks because we've thought through them."
- "Biggest risk: Carbon prices drop. But we're locking in buyer commitments at $50–60 floor. This limits our downside."
- "Second risk: Measurement uncertainty. Our CO₂ model could be wrong. But we built in 75% confidence bands + conservative assumptions. If anything, we'll exceed the model."
- "Third risk: Registry says 'no' to our integrated methodology. But we're getting Isometric pre-approval before Phase 2 deployment. No surprises."
- "Fourth risk: Landowner walks away mid-project. But 5-year binding agreements + performance bonds protect the asset."
- "None of these are deal-killers. We've addressed each with specific safeguards."

**Timeline Below:**
- **Q1 2026:** Pilots capex ($100K); Platform dev start ($40K); Team ($10K)
- **Q2–Q3 2026:** Pilot opex begins ($25K/quarter); Platform dev continues ($30K/quarter); Team ($15K/quarter)
- **Q4 2026–Q1 2027:** Opex + Verification launch ($20K/quarter); Platform scaling ($20K/quarter)

**Talking Points (45 seconds):**
- "Here's exactly where your $500K goes."
- "40% to pilots: basalt, biochar, compost, and spreading labor. Real stuff in the ground."
- "25% to platform development: the Cardano integration, dMRV backend, AI risk engine. This is the moat."
- "20% to monitoring and opex: quarterly sampling, lab analysis, lysimeter maintenance. Proof of sequestration."
- "10% to team: We're lean. Lead scientist 0.5 FTE, field tech 0.5 FTE. No overhead."
- "5% legal and contingency: SAFE docs, smart contract audit, buffer for unexpected costs."

### **SLIDE 18: INVESTOR TERMS & NEXT STEPS**

**Headline:** "Seed Series A Terms: SAFE + Capped Participation"

**Key Terms Box:**

| Term | Value |
|---|---|
| **Security Type** | SAFE with MFN + Pro-Rata |
| **Post-Money Valuation Cap** | $8M–$12M (negotiable) |
| **Discount Rate** | 20% (to Series A price) |
| **Investor Allocation** | Pro-rata to check size |
| **Lock-up Period** | None (can exit pre-verification via secondary) |
| **Liquidation Preference** | Pari-passu (all investors equal) |
| **Use of Proceeds** | Pilot capex + platform dev (see prior slide) |

**Next Steps Timeline:**

1. **This Week (Jan 31):** Investor update call + data room access
2. **Week of Feb 7:** Founder 1-on-1s, Q&A on tech + land
3. **Week of Feb 21:** Legal diligence, land title review, lab accreditation check
4. **Week of Mar 1:** SAFE drafting (counsel finalizes terms)
5. **Week of Mar 31:** Closes + wire transfer
6. **Week of Apr 1:** Pilot deployment begins

**Talking Points (45 seconds):**
- "We're raising $500K–$1.2M in a straightforward SAFE with capped participation."
- "SAFE is simple: Investors get a note that converts to equity at Series A. If we exit before Series A (acquisition, IPO), the SAFE liquidates at 1×."
- "Capped at $8M–$12M post-money valuation. This is fair for climate SaaS with real pilots and carbon science."
- "No lock-up on tokens—you can exit on secondary markets before Phase 4 verification if you need liquidity."
- "Timeline: Closes by end of March. First deployment begins April 1. Baseline samples start May 1. Real progress by summer."

### **SLIDE 19: THE ASK & CLOSING STATEMENT**

**Headline:** "We're Raising $500K–$1.2M to Build the Infrastructure Layer for Decentralized Carbon Removal"

**Closing Narrative:**

"The carbon market is broken. But it's not broken because carbon removal doesn't work—it's broken because we don't trust the verification.

Mālama Labs fixes this.

We combine blockchain-anchored proof, integrated multi-methodology carbon pathways, and deep landowner partnerships to create verifiable, bankable carbon credits at scale.

In 24 months, we'll have deployed 1,620 tCO₂e across two owned farms. By Year 5, we'll be issuing 4,050+ tCO₂e annually across 15+ projects, generating $49M+ in annual platform revenue.

For your $500K investment today:
- You're preselling 987 Liquid Carbon Tokens at $30 each
- By Year 3, these convert to 1,620 Verified Carbon Tokens at $60–120 each
- Expected investor return: +409% (3-year probability-weighted) or +73% annualized IRR
- Downside protection: Buyer commitments + conservative assumptions + land security
- Upside optionality: If carbon prices rise to $80–120/tCO₂e, returns expand to 5–9×

This is not a bet on climate change (that's already happening). It is a bet on the infrastructure that enables climate solutions to scale.

We're excited to have you join us. Let's build this together."

## SLIDE DESIGN NOTES

**Visual Style:**
- Use Mālama brand colors: Teal, coral, navy
- Minimize text per slide (headlines only; talking points are in presenter notes)
- Use high-quality imagery: soil, plants, drones, blockchain visualization
- Charts/graphs: Simple, clear, minimal clutter
- Avoid jargon; explain carbon science in plain language

**Presentation Tips:**
- 15 minutes total (slides 1–19); 5 minutes Q&A (slide 20)
- ~45 seconds per slide average
- Speak to the numbers; let visuals do heavy lifting
- Pause after big statements (e.g., "+409% expected return")
- Invite questions: "Does this make sense?" or "Any questions before we move on?"
