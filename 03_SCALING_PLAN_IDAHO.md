# Mālama Labs ERW Scaling Plan: Idaho to 1,000+ Acres

## Pilot → Commercial Deployment Roadmap

### 1. Executive Summary: 3-Year Scaling Strategy

| Phase | Year | Acreage | Cumulative | Sites | Annual Basalt | Annual Budget | Verified tCO₂e | Revenue Potential |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pilot** | 2026 | 47 | 47 | 1 | 2,380 t | $118k | 38 | $14k |
| **Scale 1** | 2027 | 250 | 297 | 3-5 | 12,500 t | $435k | 312 | $47k |
| **Scale 2** | 2028 | 500 | 797 | 8-12 | 25,000 t | $785k | 937 | $141k |
| **Steady** | 2029+ | 1,000/yr | 1,797+ | 20-30 | 50,000 t/yr | $1.4M/yr | 1,875/yr | $281k/yr |

#### Key Metrics by Year 5 (2030)

- **Cumulative acres:** 2,797 under management
- **Annual monitoring:** 1,797 acres (active verification years 1-3)
- **Total tCO₂e issued:** 4,162 credits (cumulative)
- **Revenue (@ $150/tCO₂e):** $624k cumulative
- **Operating margin:** 22% (steady state)

#### Core Strategy

- **Year 1 (Pilot):** Validate MRV, establish landowner relationships, demonstrate ROI
- **Year 2 (5×):** Leverage pilot success for Franklin County expansion + adjacent counties
- **Year 3 (10×):** Multi-county deployment, hire field staff, automate operations
- **Year 4+:** Maintain 1,000 acres/year new deployment + ongoing monitoring of existing sites

### 2. Year 1 (2026): Pilot Foundation

#### 2.1 Single Site: Pearson Parcel (47 acres)

**Objectives:**

- [x] Prove Suhrhoff MRV methodology at field scale
- [x] Establish sensor infrastructure + backend integration
- [x] Generate first verified carbon credits (target: 38 tCO₂e)
- [x] Document farmer experience (case study for recruitment)
- [x] Refine cost structure (actual vs. projected)

**Critical Success Factors:**

- **φ > 1 achieved** (feedstock addition resolvable)
- **Year 1 weathering detected** (10-20% dissolution)
- **Zero sensor downtime** (>95% uptime)
- **Positive farmer feedback** (NPS >8/10)
- **Cost per tCO₂e verified:** <$3,000 (acceptable for pilot)

---

### 3. Year 2 (2027): 250 Acres Across 3-5 Sites

#### 3.1 Expansion Strategy: Hub-and-Spoke

**Geographic Focus:** Franklin County + Preston area (30-mile radius)

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Distance from pilot | 30% | Minimize travel for sampling crews, leverage local reputation |
| Soil suitability | 25% | Silt loam preferred (proven φ >1), avoid heavy clays |
| Irrigation infrastructure | 20% | Active irrigation = consistent weathering, avoid dryland |
| Landowner engagement | 15% | Early adopters, willing to share data publicly |
| Field size | 10% | 40-80 acres ideal (economies of scale vs. risk diversification) |

#### 3.2 Operational Model: Centralized Monitoring

**Sampling Optimization:**

| Approach | Pilot (47 ac) | Year 2 (250 ac, 5 sites) | Efficiency Gain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Baseline samples | 50 (1.06/acre) | 150 total (0.6/acre) | 44% fewer per acre |
| Quarterly samples | 33 (0.7/acre) | 100 total (0.4/acre) | 43% fewer per acre |

#### 3.3 Basalt Procurement: Volume Discounts

| Volume | Price/Ton | Annual Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <3,000 t (Year 1) | $30 | $71k | Spot market, small orders |
| 10,000-15,000 t (Year 2) | $24 | $300k | Annual contract, 20% discount |
| >25,000 t (Year 3+) | $20 | $500k | Multi-year commitment, 33% discount |

---

### 4. Year 3 (2028): 500 Acres Across 8-12 Sites

#### 4.1 Geographic Expansion: Multi-County

- **Franklin (incumbent):** 150 acres (3 sites)
- **Cache (UT border):** 120 acres (2-3 sites)
- **Oneida:** 100 acres (2 sites)
- **Bannock:** 80 acres (2 sites)
- **Power:** 50 acres (1 site)

#### 4.2 Technology Leverage: Automation

- **ATV-Mounted Soil Sampler:** Speed: 50 samples/day (vs. 15 manually)
- **Operator App Enhancement:** Automated QR code generation & turn-by-turn navigation
- **Lab API Automation:** Direct LIMS integration, real-time results dashboard

---

### 5. Steady State (2029+): 1,000 Acres/Year

#### 5.1 Optimized Model Gross Margin

| Parameter | Baseline | Optimized |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application | 50 t/ac (Year 1) | 100 t/ac (50+50 over 2 years) |
| Carbon price | $150/tCO₂e | $220/tCO₂e |
| Cost sharing | Mālama 100% | Mālama 70%, Farmer 30% |
| **Gross Margin** | **-53%** | **+76%** ✅ |

---

### 6. Funding Requirements (Seed → Profitability)

- **Total Capital Required:** $1.85M (cumulative through 2028)
- **Break-Even:** Q3 2030 (Year 5)

---

### 7. Strategic Risks & Mitigation

- **Adoption:** 30% farmer cost-share + peer referral program
- **Weathering:** Increased application rate (100 t/ac) for slow sites
- **Pricing:** Locking multi-year offtake agreements (Frontier/Microsoft)
- **Logistics:** Dual-source quarry strategy with 6-month stockpiles
