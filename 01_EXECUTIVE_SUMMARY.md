# MĀLAMA LABS: INVESTOR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Climate Fintech Infrastructure for Decentralized Carbon Removal
**Series A Seed Funding: $500,000** | **Valuation: $8M** | **Date: January 29, 2026**

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Market Context:**
The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is projected to grow from $0.9 trillion (2025) to $5+ trillion by 2030. However, 80% of credits face greenwashing concerns due to poor MRV (Monitoring, Reporting & Verification) and lack of transparency.

**The Problem:**
- Traditional carbon credit verification takes 12–18 months and costs $50K–$200K per project
- Credits lack real-time auditability; regulators and corporate buyers demand immutable proof-of-sequestration
- Land-based carbon projects (ERW, biochar, soil carbon) remain underinvested due to execution risk and verification bottlenecks
- Hardware-focused competitors (DAC, biochar producers) struggle to raise "missing middle" capital ($1–5M) needed for first-of-a-kind plants

**Mālama's Solution:**
A climate fintech platform combining:
1. **Decentralized MRV (dMRV):** Real-time IoT sensors + blockchain anchoring + AI risk scoring
2. **Multi-Methodology Stack:** ERW + biochar + soil carbon + nutrient optimization (3–4× CO₂e per acre vs. single-pathway competitors)
3. **Tokenized Carbon Credit Lifecycle:** LCT (presale 24-month lock-up) → VCT (verified, tradeable post-verification)
4. **Landowner Alignment:** 35% revenue share to farmers/land stewards; $303K/acre blended benefit

---

## THE SOLUTION: INTEGRATED CARBON REMOVAL PLATFORM

### **Technology Stack**
- **dMRV:** Cardano blockchain + IPFS + IoT sensors + AI risk engine
- **Methodologies:** Isometric ERW v1.1 + Puro Biochar v3.0 + soil C protocols + nutrient optimization
- **Token Economics:** Native LCO₂ (liquid) / VCO₂ (verified) tokens on Cardano
- **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL backend + React frontend + FastAPI microservices

### **De-Risking Model**
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1–2):** Baseline + PDD development + AI risk scoring → LCT presale (60–65% of projected removal)
2. **Phase 2 (Months 3–4):** Sensor-verified deployment + tracer confirmation (Ti spike)
3. **Phase 3 (Months 5–30):** Quarterly monitoring + continuous blockchain anchoring
4. **Phase 4 (Months 24–30):** Third-party verification + net CDR calculation + VCT issuance
