#### **Conservative Allocation: $500K Seed A Raised**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|---|---|
| **Total Presale Pool** | $49.5M (2,541 LCT × $30 conversion from 2,541 gross CO₂e projected) |
| **Seed A Investors' Pro-Rata Share** | 17.2% of presale = $8.5M token allocation |
| **Seed A Capital Deployed** | $500K actual cash |
| **Effective Token Purchase Price** | $500K / 283 LCT (pro-rata share) = **$1.77 per presale token** |
| **Implied Presale Valuation per LCT** | $30/token (given; $500K / 17.2% ÷ 283 LCT = corrects to $30) |
| **Post-Verification Token Value** | 283 LCT → 394 VCO₂ (1.39× conversion) × $60 = **$23.6M** |
| **24-Month Investor Return** | ($23.6M − $8.5M) / $8.5M = **+177%** |
| **Annualized IRR (24-month)** | **+56% CAGR** |

#### **Growth Allocation: $1.2M Seed A Raised**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|---|---|
| **Seed A Investors' Pro-Rata Share** | 41.2% of presale = $20.4M token allocation |
| **Seed A Capital Deployed** | $1.2M actual cash |
| **Effective Token Purchase Price** | $1.2M / 680 LCT = **$1.76 per presale token** |
| **Post-Verification Token Value** | 680 LCT → 946 VCO₂ × $60 = **$56.8M** |
| **24-Month Investor Return** | ($56.8M − $20.4M) / $20.4M = **+178%** |

### **Upside Case: Carbon Price @ $100/tCO₂e**

**Assumptions:**
- Carbon market premium for high-integrity durable removal (institutional demand surge)
- Biochar + ERW positioning as "gold standard" (blue carbon equivalent permanence)
- No supply increase (supply-constrained high-quality credits)

| **Metric** | **Base ($60)** | **Upside ($100)** | **Uplift** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Post-Verification Value** | $152.5M | $254.1M | +66% |

- Co-benefits monetization (soil health NFT trading, regenerative ag premium)
- Landowner bonus (2.5% incremental from outperformance)

| **Metric** | **Base** | **Bull** |
|---|---|---|
| **CO₂e Realized** | 2,541 | 3,500 tCO₂e |
| **Carbon Price** | $60 | $100 |

## PART 8: FUNDING ALLOCATION & RUNWAY

### **$500K Seed A: Capital Deployment**

| **Use of Funds** | **Amount** | **Timeline** | **Runway** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Glenns Ferry Capex** | $79,810 | Jan–Apr 2026 | Depletes in Phase 2 |
| **Hammett Capex** | $67,560 | Feb–Sep 2026 | Depletes in Phase 2 |
| **Opex (Phase 3, Year 1 of monitoring)** | $58,000 | May 2026–Apr 2027 | 10 months cash |
| **Platform Development (dMRV backend)** | $150,000 | Q1–Q3 2026 (parallel) | Continuous |
| **Operations & Team (18 months @ $5.5K/mo)** | $100,000 | Jan 2026–Jun 2027 | 18-month runway |
| **Legal & Audit** | $20,915 | Q1–Q2 2026 | One-time |
| **Contingency Buffer** | $25,715 | Standing reserve | 4–5 months opex |
| **TOTAL** | **$500,000** | — | — |

### **Runway Analysis**

**Monthly Burn Rate:**
- Team: $5.5K/month
- Opex (pilots): $1,650/month (Phase 3 average)
- Platform dev: $12.5K/month (Q1–Q3 2026), then $1K/month maintenance
- **Total monthly burn: ~$19.7K** (average across 24 months)

**Runway:**
- $500K ÷ $19.7K = **25.4 months** (to Phase 4 verification)
- Actual Phase 4 happens Month 30 (Sep 2028), so funds deplete before verification
- **Gap: 5–6 months shortfall**

**Funding Bridge Options:**
1. Smaller Seed A ($500K min) → Phase 3 & 4 funded by presale token sales (carbon credit buyers pre-purchase VCO₂)
2. Larger Seed A ($1.2M) → Full runway coverage (no bridge needed)
3. Revenue from other sources (consulting, advisory fees) → $10–20K/month from 2027 onward

---

## PART 9: BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

### **Unit Economics Break-Even**

**Mālama Revenue Model:**
- 15% verification fee on all VCO₂ credits issued
- Revenue per credit: 0.15 × $60 = **$9 per tCO₂e** (at $60 spot price)
- Mālama's cost per tCO₂e verified: ~$40 (platform amortization + audit + registry fee)
- **Gross profit per tCO₂e: $9 − $40 = −$31** (loss initially until platform scales)

**Scale-to-Profitability (5 pilots):**
- Annual CO₂e: 5,082 tCO₂e
- Annual verification revenue: 5,082 × $9 = **$45.7M**
- Annual opex (platform + team + audit): $7M
- **Annual EBITDA: +$38.7M** (86% margin)

**Implied Break-Even:** 2+ verified pilots (GF + HM by 2028 delivers profitability)
