#### **3. Conversion Triggers**

**Automatic Conversion (on earliest of):**

a) **Series A Equity Financing:** When company raises $750K+ in equity priced round

   - Pro-rata rights: Investor can participate in Series A pro-rata to stake

b) **Acquisition or IPO:** Company sells or IPOs

   - If $20M–$50M exit: SAFE converts + pro-rata equity (on acquisition value)
   - If $50M+ exit: SAFE converts at favorable cap + equity kicker

c) **Dissolution:** Company shuts down
   - SAFE note treated as unsecured debt (investor receives remaining assets pro-rata)
   - Falls to last priority (after secured debt, but pari-passu with common equity)

- Right to attend board meetings (non-voting)
- Access to all board materials
- Quarterly updates even if no board seat

**MFN Clause:**

## SECTION 4: SAMPLE INVESTOR ALLOCATIONS

### **Scenario: $1.2M Seed A Raise (Target)**

#### **Allocation Approach A: Institutional + Strategic**

| **Investor** | **Check Size** | **Type** | **Total Commitment** | **Notes** |

| **Strategic (Big Ag or Supply Chain)** | $200K | Corporate | $200K | Potential customer; strategic alignment |

| **Total** | — | — | **$1.2M** | — |

**Investor Rights by Tier:**

| **Tier** | **Check Size** | **Pro-Rata Right** | **Board Seat** | **Information Rights** | **Special Perks** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Total** | — | — | **$500K** |

**Note:** Smaller raise ($500K) covers 2-pilot MVP. Larger raise ($1.2M) accelerates 5-pilot strategy + team expansion.

## SECTION 5: LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE MATRIX

### **SAFE Liquidation Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Acquisition (9-Month Timeline)**

**Company is acquired for $40M.**

| **Step** | **Calculation** |
|---|---|
| 1. **Total SAFE outstanding** | $1.2M (Seed A) + $300K (Friends & Family) = $1.5M total notes |
| 2. **Valuation cap used** | $8M (company sold before Series A) |
| 3. **Implied ownership** | $1.5M / $8M = 18.75% stake (post-dilution) |
| 4. **Investor equity value** | $40M × 18.75% = $7.5M |
| 5. **Founder equity value** | $40M × 80% = $32M (remaining after dilution from option pool) |
| 6. **Employee option pool value** | $40M × 1.25% = $500K (distributed to vested employees) |
| **Total Distribution** | $7.5M (investors) + $32M (founders) + $500K (employees) + payoff debt = $40M |

**Investor Proceeds by Tier:**

| **Investor** | **SAFE Note** | **Ownership %** | **Proceeds (40M exit)** | **Return** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anchor ($300K)** | $300K @ 8M cap | 3.75% | $1.5M | **5.0× return** |
| **Co-Lead ($200K)** | $200K @ 8M cap | 2.5% | $1M | **5.0× return** |
| **Impact ($250K)** | $250K @ 8M cap | 3.125% | $1.25M | **5.0× return** |
| **Angels ($250K)** | $250K @ 8M cap | 3.125% | $1.25M | **5.0× return** |
| **Friends & Family ($200K)** | $200K @ 8M cap | 2.5% | $1M | **5.0× return** |
| **Total Investors ($1.2M)** | — | 15% | $7.5M | **6.25× blended** |

**Founder Proceeds:**
- Combined stake: 67.5% (post-dilution) = $27M
- Per founder (equal split): ~$9M each

**Employee Pool Proceeds:**
- 1.25% of exit = $500K distributed to 2–3 key employees

**Note:** This assumes SAFE converts at $8M cap (lower than company's actual value); investors get upside participation.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Series A (18–24 Months)**

**Company raises $10M Series A at $50M pre-money valuation.**

| **Step** | **Calculation** |
|---|---|
| 1. **Series A price per share** | Need to back into this from pre-money |
| 2. **SAFE conversion trigger** | Automatic: SAFE holders get better of (a) $8M cap or (b) 20% discount |
| 3. **Series A price** | $50M pre / 5M shares = $10/share |
| 4. **SAFE discount (20%)** | $10 × 0.8 = $8/share |
| 5. **SAFE cap alternative** | $8M cap / 5M shares = $1.60/share |
| 6. **Better for investor** | $1.60/share (cap) is much better than $8/share (discount) |
| 7. **SAFE investor receives** | $1.2M SAFE / $1.60/share = 750,000 shares |
| 8. **Post-Series-A shares outstanding** | 5M (pre-existing) + 1M (Series A) = 6M total |
| 9. **Post-Series-A investor ownership** | 750K / 6M = 12.5% (diluted from 15%, but still strong) |
| 10. **Investor proceeds (Series A)** | Shares vest over time; no immediate cash (unless secondary sold) |

**Ownership Breakdown Post-Series A:**

| **Stakeholder** | **Shares** | **Ownership %** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Founders (original)** | 1M | 16.7% | (diluted from 67.5% due to Series A) |
| **Employee Option Pool** | 100K | 1.7% | (fully diluted) |
| **SAFE Investors** | 750K | 12.5% | Converted at favorable cap |
| **Series A Investors** | 1M (new) | 16.7% | Fresh capital |
| **Series A Investor (Lead, potential)** | + Preferred share class | + Board seat | Preferred shares have liquidation preference ahead of common |
| **Total** | 6M | 100% | — |

**Key Point:** SAFE holders participate in future upside without giving up governance (no board seat, no control). Series A investors typically get preferred equity + board seats.

---

### **Scenario 3: IPO or Large Exit ($500M+)**

**Company goes public at $500M valuation.**

| **Stakeholder** | **Ownership %** | **Value @ IPO** | **Return on $X Investment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SAFE Investors** | 12.5% | $62.5M | 52× ($1.2M → $62.5M) |
| **Founders** | 16.7% | $83.5M | 83× each ($1M → $83.5M share) |
| **Series A (pro-rata)** | 16.7% | $83.5M | Depends on round size |
| **Employees (vested options)** | 1–2% | $5M–$10M | Per grant + vesting |

**Investor Proceed Distribution (Illustrative):**
- Anchor investor $300K SAFE → $15.6M @ IPO
- Co-lead investor $200K SAFE → $10.4M @ IPO
- Impact investor $250K SAFE → $13M @ IPO
- Angel group $250K SAFE → $13M @ IPO
- Friends & family $200K SAFE → $10.4M @ IPO

## SECTION 6: INVESTOR RIGHTS & PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS

### **Protective Provisions (Standard VC Terms)**

Once Series A is raised with Preferred Stock, the following decisions require approval of **holders of majority Series A Preferred shares** (typical):

1. **Liquidation Events:** Sale, merger, IPO, dissolution
2. **Capital Raises:** Any new equity issuance changing cap table by >10%
3. **Budget Approval:** Annual budget must be approved
4. **Dividend Distributions:** Any cash distribution to shareholders
5. **Executive Compensation:** CEO comp above threshold (e.g., $500K)
6. **Related-Party Transactions:** Deals with founders, advisors >$100K
7. **Employee Equity:** Option pool grants >$1M annually
8. **Debt Issuance:** Borrowing >$5M
9. **Affiliate Transactions:** Business with related entities

**Note:** SAFE holders do NOT have these rights until conversion to equity (Series A). This is tradeoff for early investment + discount.

---

## SECTION 7: ANTI-DILUTION PROTECTION (For Series A / Future Rounds)

### **Standard Anti-Dilution Provisions**

Once SAFE converts to Preferred Stock (Series A), typical anti-dilution protections include:

**Broad-Based Weighted Average (Most Common):**
- If later round prices below Series A price, Series A shares are repriced
- Formula: `New conversion price = Old price × (A + B) / (A + C)`
  - A = pre-money valuation of Series A
  - B = Series A investment amount
  - C = new round investment amount
- **Effect:** Softens dilution but shares pain between old and new investors

**Example:**
- Series A: $10M invested at $50M pre-money = $10/share
- Series B (down round): $5M invested at $40M pre-money = $8/share
- Series A repricing: $10 × ($50M + $10M) / ($50M + $5M) = $9.09/share (between $10 and $8)

**Narrow-Based Weighted Average (Rare, Founder-Friendly):**
- Only counts Series A shares, not all common (reduces reprice impact)
- Favors early investors less

**Full Ratchet (Aggressive, VC-Friendly):**
- If new round is lower, Series A shares reprice 1:1 to new price (harsh to founders)
- Rarely used today

**Most Likely for Mālama:** Broad-based weighted average (standard in 2026 VC practice)
