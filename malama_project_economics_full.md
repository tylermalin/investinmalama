### 1.3 Revenue & Token Economics (Glenns Ferry)

#### **Presale Token Issuance (LCT - Liquid Carbon Token)**

**Phase 1 Risk Score Calculation:**

| **Criterion** | **Weight** | **Score** | **Component Points** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Project Completeness** | 30% | 95/100 | 28.5 |
| **Economic Feasibility** | 20% | 90/100 | 18.0 |
| **Developer Reputation** | 25% | 75/100 | 18.75 |
| **Methodology Risk** | 25% | 88/100 | 22.0 |
| **Total Score** | 100% | **83.5/100** | **87.25 / 100** |

**LCT Minting Logic:**
- Projected Gross Removal: 350 tCO₂e
- Risk Score: 83.5/100 → Presale Percentage: **65%**
- **LCT Minted:** 350 × 0.65 = **227.5 LCT** (rounded 227)
- Lock-up Period: 24 months (until Phase 4 verification)

#### **Token Value Scenarios**

**Baseline Carbon Market Pricing (Jan 2026):**
- **Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM):** $25–60/tCO₂e
- **High-Integrity Credits (Durable Removal):** $40–120/tCO₂e
- **Mālama Token Premium (blockchain + dMRV):** +20–30% vs. spot credits

**LCT Valuation Scenarios:**

| **Scenario** | **Credit Price** | **LCT Base Value** | **Presale Markdown (24-mo lock)** | **Net LCT Price** | **Total Presale Revenue** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** | $40/tCO₂e | $40 | −50% | **$20/LCT** | 227 × $20 = **$4.54M** |
| **Base Case** | $60/tCO₂e | $60 | −50% | **$30/LCT** | 227 × $30 = **$6.81M** |
| **Optimistic** | $80/tCO₂e | $80 | −40% | **$48/LCT** | 227 × $48 = **$10.9M** |
| **Bull Case** | $120/tCO₂e | $120 | −30% | **$84/LCT** | 227 × $84 = **$19.1M** |

**Base Case Assumption (for modeling):** $30/LCT presale valuation = **$6.81M** total presale revenue.

#### **Verified Carbon Token (VCT) Issuance (Phase 4)**

**Year 2–3 Post-Verification:**

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|
| **Projected Gross CO₂ Removal** | 350 tCO₂e | 3-year baseline observation |
| **Less: LCA (Quarry, Transport, Spreading)** | −2.5 tCO₂e | Embedded emissions (~0.7% of gross) |
| **Less: Crop Export (Alfalfa Cation Removal)** | −10 tCO₂e | 3-year harvest cation removal (~3% of gross) |
| **Less: Buffer Pool (5%, permanence/uncertainty)** | −16.5 tCO₂e | Conservative buffer for 10,000-yr durability claim |
| **Net VCO₂ Certified & Minted** | **315 tCO₂e** | Registry-issued, serialized tokens |

**LCT Burn & VCT Mint Logic:**
- LCT Outstanding: 227 LCT (65% presale)
- VCT Minted: 315 VCO₂ (verified removal)
- **LCT Burn:** 227 (1:1 conversion, then destruction)
- **VCT Remaining on Market:** 315 − 227 = **88 VCO₂** (incremental value to Mālama/landowner)

#### **Post-Verification Token Economics**

**Scenario: Base Case ($60/tCO₂e credit market price)**

| **Token Type** | **Quantity** | **Unit Price** | **Total Value** | **Ownership** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LCT (Presale, Phase 2)** | 227 | $30 (50% markdown) | $6.81M | Token holders (investors) | Lock-up 24 months; then swap for VCT at 1:1.39 ratio |
| **VCT (Verified, Phase 4)** | 315 | $60 (market rate) | $18.9M | Distributed to LCT holders + Mālama + Landowner | Portfolio allocation TBD in operating agreement |
| **Incremental Value (88 VCT unallocated)** | 88 | $60 | $5.28M | Mālama Labs (platform take) + Landowner bonus | 35% Mālama / 65% Landowner (est.) |
| **Total Post-Verification Value** | — | — | **$30.99M** | — | All tokens liquid on secondary markets |

**Presale Investor Return (24-month hold):**
- Purchase: 227 LCT @ $30 = $6.81M invested
- Maturity Value: 227 LCT → 315 VCO₂ @ $60 = $18.9M received
- **3-Year ROI:** ($18.9M − $6.81M) / $6.81M = **+177%** (simple; doesn't account for time-value or alternative investments)
- **Annualized Return:** ((18.9 / 6.81)^(1/3) − 1) = **+51.8% CAGR** (competitive for early-stage climate tech)

### 1.4 Landowner Economics (Glenns Ferry)

#### **Landowner Revenue Sharing Model**

**Assumption:** 35% Landowner / 65% Mālama Labs (standard carbon project split)

| **Revenue Stream** | **Gross Value** | **Landowner Share (35%)** | **Mālama Share (65%)** | **Payment Schedule** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VCT Issuance (315 tCO₂e @ $60)** | $18.9M | **$6.62M** | $12.28M | Year 2–3 (post-verification) |
| **Incremental Value (88 unallocated VCT @ $60)** | $5.28M | **$3.43M** (65% landowner incentive) | $1.85M | Year 2–3 (outperformance bonus) |
| **Land Use Royalty (5-year term)** | $0 (alternative: $500/acre/year) | **$0 (or $25K/yr)** | — | Annual, if structured as rental |
| **Total Landowner Benefit** | — | **$10.05M** (or $10.3M w/ royalty) | **$14.13M** | — |

**Landowner Perspective:**
- **Land committed:** 100 acres for 5 years
- **Opportunity cost:** Foregone alfalfa revenue (~$60–80/acre/year = $6K–$8K/year = $30K–$40K over 5 years)
- **Net benefit:** $10.05M − $35K = **$10.01M** (284:1 ROI ratio; ~$100K/acre)
- **Per-acre annual equivalent:** $10.05M / 100 acres / 5 years = **$20.1K/acre/year**

**Why Landowner Accepts 35% Share:**
- Lower risk: Mālama bears science/verification risk
- No capex: Mālama funds all monitoring
- Land stays productive: Alfalfa can continue on non-deployed acres
- Community benefit: Soil health improvement (pH buffer, microbial activity)

### 3.3 Landowner Economics (Combined Portfolio)

#### **Total Landowner Benefit**

**Assumption:** 35% landowner / 65% Mālama split (standard for carbon projects)

| **Property** | **Net VCO₂** | **Market Value @ $60** | **Landowner 35%** | **Alternative (5-yr alfalfa revenue)** | **Net Benefit** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Glenns Ferry** | 315 tCO₂e | $18.9M | $6.62M | $25K–$40K (100 acres × 5 yrs) | **+$6.58M** |
| **Hammett** | 225 tCO₂e | $13.5M | $4.73M | $20K–$35K (85 acres × 5 yrs) | **+$4.70M** |
| **Combined** | 540 tCO₂e | $32.4M | **$11.34M** | **$45K–$75K** | **+$11.27M** |

**Per-Acre Landowner Value:**
- Glenns Ferry: $6.62M / 100 acres = **$66.2K/acre**
- Hammett: $4.73M / 85 acres = **$55.6K/acre**
- **Blended:** $11.34M / 185 acres = **$61.3K/acre**

**5-Year Equivalent Annual Payment:**
- Glenns Ferry: $6.62M / 5 years = **$1.32M/year** (~$13.2K/acre/year)
- Hammett: $4.73M / 5 years = **$946K/year** (~$11.1K/acre/year)

**Landowner Perspective on Risk-Return:**
- **Upside:** If carbon price rises to $80–120/tCO₂e, landowner participates (fixed 35% share)
- **Downside:** If carbon price falls below $40/tCO₂e, payment reduced proportionally
- **Non-financial benefits:** Soil health improvement, water retention, potential premium for regenerative agriculture

## SECTION 4: MĀLAMA LABS PLATFORM ECONOMICS

### 4.1 Revenue Model (SaaS + Platform Take)

#### **Verification Fee Model (Recommended)**

Mālama charges **15% of verified credit value** as platform/verification service fee.

| **Project** | **Net VCO₂** | **Market Price (Base Case)** | **Credit Value** | **Mālama Fee (15%)** | **Gross Margin (after costs)** | **Net Margin %** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Glenns Ferry** | 315 | $60 | $18.9M | **$2.84M** | $2.84M − $91.8K opex = $2.75M | **97%** |
| **Hammett** | 225 | $60 | $13.5M | **$2.03M** | $2.03M − $88.7K opex = $1.94M | **96%** |
| **Combined (2 Pilots)** | 540 | $60 | $32.4M | **$4.87M** | $4.87M − $180.5K opex = $4.69M | **96%** |

**Scaled Model (5 Pilots, 2700 tCO₂e/year):**
- Annual verification revenue: 2,700 tCO₂e × $60 × 15% = **$24.3M**
- Scaled opex (monitoring): ~$400K/year (shared infrastructure)
- **Net margin:** $24.3M − $0.4M = **$23.9M** (98% margin)

#### **Alternative Revenue Structures**

| **Model** | **Revenue per Credit** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-tCO₂e Fee (15%)** | $9/tCO₂e (on $60 credits) | Scales with credit value; aligns with landowner | Variable income (carbon price dependent) |
| **Flat Annual Fee** | $100K–$200K/project/year | Predictable; covers opex | May undervalue large projects |
| **Hybrid (Base + Variable)** | $50K base + 7% variable | Risk-sharing; predictable floor | Complex accounting |
| **Subscription (per acre)** | $50–100/acre/year | Simple; predictable | Misaligned with carbon value |

**Recommendation:** Hybrid model (65% to landowner / 35% Mālama with 15% fee on Mālama's share) = sustainable long-term alignment.

### 4.2 Path to Profitability & Unit Economics

#### **Scaling Assumptions (2026–2030)**

| **Year** | **Pilots Active** | **Acres Deployed** | **tCO₂e/Year** | **Net Revenue (15% @ $60)** | **Opex (Monitoring + Admin)** | **Net Income** | **Cumulative Cash** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2026** | 1 (GF Phase 1–2) | 0 | 0 | $0 | $52K (capex) | **−$52K** | **−$52K** |
| **2027** | 2 (GF Phase 3, HM Phase 1–2) | 185 | 0 (monitoring year) | $0 | $148K | **−$148K** | **−$200K** |
| **2028** | 2 (GF Phase 4, HM Phase 3) | 185 | 540 (GF verification only) | **$4.87M** | $130K | **+$4.74M** | **+$4.54M** |
| **2029** | 3 (Add 3rd pilot) | 280 | 810 (GF + HM verified) | **$7.29M** | $280K | **+$7.01M** | **+$11.55M** |
| **2030** | 5 (Add 4th, 5th) | 450 | 1,350 (GF + HM + 3 new) | **$12.15M** | $450K | **+$11.7M** | **+$23.25M** |

**Key Insight:** Profitability inflection at Year 3 (2028) with first verified credits. Subsequent years show exponential margin expansion due to fixed infrastructure costs spreading across more projects.

#### **Unit Economics (Mature State, Year 5)**

| **Metric** | **Per Project** | **Per Acre** | **Per tCO₂e** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Capex** | $50K | $500 | $91 |
| **Opex (3-year)** | $90K | $900 | $164 |
| **Total Cost** | $140K | $1,400 | $255 |
| **Revenue (15% fee @ $60/tCO₂e)** | $4.87M (GF) | $48.7K | $9 |
| **Gross Margin** | 97% | 94% | 96% |
| **LTV (3-year lifetime)** | $4.87M | $48.7K | $9 |
| **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** | $50K (capex) | $500 | $91 |
| **LTV/CAC Ratio** | **97.4×** | **97.4×** | **99× |

**Interpretation:** Corporate-grade unit economics (aim for 3–5× LTV/CAC for SaaS; Mālama's dMRV platform achieves ~100×).

| **2029** | Scale Phase 4 | Mature | VCT issued | 2 new pilots start | 540 (GF+HM) | **$4.87M** | **+$7.18M** |
| **2030** | Scaled operations | Mature | Mature | 3 new pilots mature | 1,350 (5 projects) | **$12.15M** | **+$19.33M** |

**Year 5 Valuation (DCF, 10% discount rate):**
- Terminal EBITDA (Year 5): $11.7M
- Terminal multiple (SaaS, climate tech): 4–6× EBITDA
- **Implied valuation (Year 5):** $46.8M–$70.2M (mid-point: **$58.5M**)
- **Return to $10.77M presale investors:** 4.4–6.5× (+ 44–147% total return, ~37–50% CAGR)

---

### 5.2 Sensitivity Analysis: Carbon Price Fluctuation

**Key Risk:** VCM credit prices are volatile (±30% year-to-year swings possible).

| **Carbon Price Path** | **2028 GF Revenue** | **2030 Portfolio Revenue** | **Year 5 Valuation** | **Investor 5-Yr Return** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **$30/tCO₂e (Downside)** | $1.42M | $6.08M | $24.3M | **1.9–2.3×** (−25% to 0% absolute return) |
| **$40/tCO₂e (Conservative)** | $1.90M | $8.10M | $32.4M | **2.5–3.1×** (+26–54% return, 21–27% CAGR) |
| **$60/tCO₂e (Base Case)** | $2.84M | $12.15M | $48.6M | **3.8–4.7×** (+60–87% return, 32–37% CAGR) |
| **$80/tCO₂e (Optimistic)** | $3.79M | $16.20M | $64.8M | **5.1–6.3×** (+87–117% return, 38–43% CAGR) |
| **$120/tCO₂e (Bull)** | $5.69M | $24.30M | $97.2M | **7.6–9.4×** (+138–167% return, 50–58% CAGR) |

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Hedging:** Presale investors hedge $30–40/tCO₂e minimum via forward contracts with buyer (e.g., Microsoft, Amazon)
2. **Blended offtake:** Portfolio sells 40% @ presale, 60% @ spot market (reduces downside to $40–50/tCO₂e equivalent)
3. **Buyer agreements:** Secure multi-year purchase commitments from corporates (reduces price volatility)

---

### 5.3 Exit Scenarios for Investors

#### **Scenario 1: Presale LCT Hold-to-Maturity (Baseline)**

- **Entry:** 227 GF LCT + 132 HM LCT = 359 LCT @ $30 = $10.77M (Month 4, 2026)
- **Hold:** 24 months (lock-up period)
- **Exit:** Month 28 (April 2028), VCT conversion at 1:1.39 ratio (315 GF + 225 HM = 540 VCO₂)
- **Proceeds:** 540 VCO₂ × $60 = **$32.4M** (base case)
- **Return:** +201% (3-year simple; +58% annualized)

#### **Scenario 2: Secondary Market Sale (Liquidity at Month 18)**

- **Entry:** $10.77M LCT (Month 4, 2026)
- **Exit:** Month 18 (Oct 2027), sell LCT to secondary market at 70% of Phase 4 implied value
  - Phase 4 implied value: 359 LCT × 1.39 ratio × $50 (discounted) = ~$24.9M
  - 70% of $24.9M = $17.4M
- **Proceeds:** $17.4M
- **Return:** +62% (14-month hold; ~43% annualized)
- **Trade-off:** Earlier liquidity, lower return vs. hold-to-maturity

#### **Scenario 3: Partial Exit with Reinvestment**

- **Entry:** $10.77M (2026)
- **Partial sale (Month 12):** Sell 50% of LCT at $25/LCT (rising markets) = $5.39M proceeds
- **Reinvest:** $5.39M into 3rd–4th pilot LCT (new 2027 offerings)
- **Maturity (Month 28):** Remaining 50% of original LCT (180 VCO₂) + new pilot allocation
- **Portfolio return:** 2.5–3.5× total (across multiple projects)
- **Benefit:** Diversification + rolling returns (staggered exits)

## SECTION 6: FUNDING REQUIREMENTS & ALLOCATION

### 6.1 Capital Raise Strategy

#### **Total Funding Need (2 Pilots)**

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Capex** | **Opex Reserve** | **Total** | **Funding Round** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1–2 (Setup & Deploy)** | Jan–Apr 2026 | **$100,000** | $20,000 | $120,000 | **Seed A** |
| **Phase 3 (Monitoring, Year 1)** | May 2026–Apr 2027 | — | $54,000 | $54,000 | **Operating Cash** |
| **Phase 3 (Monitoring, Year 2)** | May 2027–Apr 2028 | — | $54,000 | $54,000 | **Operating Cash** |
| **Phase 4 (Verification)** | May–Sep 2028 | — | $13,700 | $13,700 | **Operating Cash** |
| **Total 4-Year Funding** | — | $100,000 | $141,700 | **$241,700** | — |

#### **Seed Series A Funding Round ($500K Target)**

| **Use of Funds** | **Amount** | **% of Round** |
|---|---|---|
| **Glenns Ferry Capex** | $52,000 | 10.4% |
| **Hammett Capex** | $48,000 | 9.6% |
| **Monitoring Opex (Years 1–2, both pilots)** | $108,000 | 21.6% |
| **Verification & Admin (Phase 4)** | $27,400 | 5.5% |
| **Platform Development (dMRV backend)** | $150,000 | 30% |
| **Operations & Team (18 months)** | $100,000 | 20% |
| **Legal, Consulting, Contingency** | $14,600 | 2.9% |
| **Total** | **$500,000** | **100%** |

**Rationale:**
- $100K minimum capex (2 pilots) to generate real-world verification data
- $150K platform development (backend APIs, Cardano integration, Oracle setup) amortized across pilots
- $100K team costs (part-time lead, field tech, community manager)
- Excess ($120K) retained as buffer for Year 2–3 scaling

---

### 6.2 Token Economics & Investor Terms

#### **Presale Terms (Seed Series A)**

| **Term** | **Value** |
|---|---|
| **Offering:** | 359 LCT (Glenns Ferry 227 + Hammett 132) |
| **Presale Price:** | $30/LCT = $10.77M fully diluted valuation |
| **Investor Allocation:** | $500K check → 16.67 LCT (fractional) or participation in $10.77M round pro-rata |
| **Lock-up:** | 24 months (to Phase 4 verification, ~Apr 2028) |
| **Conversion:** | 1 LCT → 1.39 VCO₂ (based on 315 GF + 225 HM / 359 LCT) |
| **Liquidation Preference:** | Pari-passu among LCT holders; no preferred equity structure |
| **Governance:** | Standard SAFEs/convertible token terms (TBD with legal) |

#### **Post-Verification Token Distribution**

**Assumption:** Tokens distributed among (1) Presale investors, (2) Mālama Labs (platform incentive), (3) Landowners (performance bonus)

| **Party** | **LCT Converted** | **VCO₂ Allocated** | **Ownership %** | **Value @ $60** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Presale Investors** | 359 LCT | 499.2 VCO₂ | 92.5% | $29.95M |
| **Mālama Labs Platform** | — | 27 VCO₂ (incremental) | 5.0% | $1.62M |
| **Landowners Bonus** | — | 14 VCO₂ (outperformance) | 2.5% | $0.84M |
| **Total Issued** | — | 540 VCO₂ | 100% | $32.4M |

**Rationale:**
- Presale investors capture bulk of upside (92.5%) with 24-month lock-up risk premium
- Mālama retains 5% for platform operations, reinvestment in R&D
- Landowners receive 2.5% bonus for above-target performance (incentivizes care + data quality)

## SECTION 7: RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

### 7.1 Key Financial Risks

| **Risk** | **Probability** | **Impact** | **Downside Scenario** | **Mitigation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Carbon Price Collapse** | Medium (20%) | High (−70% revenue) | Price drops to $20–30/tCO₂e; presale investors lose capital | Establish buyer commitments; hedge with forwards; diversify credits (biochar + forestry) |
| **Soil Baseline Variance** | Low (10%) | Medium (−20% CO₂) | Actual CO₂ removal 20% below model (soil CEC lower than expected) | Conservative baseline assumptions; quarterly lysimeter pulls reduce uncertainty by Year 2 |
| **Verification Rejection** | Very Low (3%) | High (100% loss of credits) | VVB audit fails; credits not issued due to additionality dispute | Isometric pre-approval + conservative buffer pool (5–6%) ensures protocol compliance |
| **Landowner Default** | Very Low (2%) | Medium (project delay) | Landowner withdraws land mid-monitoring (Years 1–2) | 5-year binding land-use agreement; title insurance; performance bond |
| **Regulatory Change** | Low (10%) | Medium (−30% market value) | New carbon accounting standards reduce credit demand | Diversify across Article 6.4, Verra, gold-standard registries |
| **Team Turnover** | Medium (25%) | Low (+ operational cost) | Key scientist leaves; verification delays | Competitive comp, clear ownership, mentorship structure |

---

### 7.2 Mitigation Strategy Summary

**Tier 1 (Critical):**
1. **Buyer Commitments:** Secure 40%+ of credits sold via offtake agreements (e.g., Microsoft commitment = floor price $50–60/tCO₂e)
2. **Methodology Pre-Approval:** Isometric sign-off on Phase 1 baseline before Phase 2 deployment (confirms VCT path)
3. **Land Security:** 5-year binding agreements + title insurance for both Glenns Ferry & Hammett

**Tier 2 (Important):**
4. **Quarterly Monitoring:** Aggressive porewater sampling (vs. annual) to de-risk Year 2–3 weathering proof
5. **Scope Flexibility:** Option to expand to non-irrigated Hammett parcels (141 acres) if irrigated pilot succeeds
6. **Credit Blending:** Diversify across soil types (Baldock + Buko) to prove replicability early

**Tier 3 (Operational):**
7. **Team & Governance:** Attract climate-tech advisors; establish SAB (Scientific Advisory Board) for annual reviews
8. **Financial Reserves:** Maintain 6-month opex buffer ($80K) from seed round for unexpected costs

---
