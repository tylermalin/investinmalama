## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Soil baseline characterization across 100-acre ERW deployment zone (Glenns Ferry pilot) reveals favorable conditions for basalt-enhanced rock weathering on Baldock loam (0–2% slopes). Baseline soil chemistry, hydrology, and land-use history support robust CO₂ removal quantification via Phase 1–4 monitoring protocol (Isometric ERW v1.1). Expected gross removal: **350–420 tCO₂e** (3-year observation window); net (post-LCA & buffer): **330–400 tCO₂e**.

## SECTION 2: SOIL PHYSICAL & CHEMICAL BASELINE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Soil Series Profile: Baldock Loam (Typical Profile)

| **Horizon** | **Depth (cm)** | **Texture** | **Color (Munsell)** | **Structure** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ap (plow layer)** | 0–25 | Loam | 10YR 5/3 (brown) | Moderate subangular blocky, granular |

| **C** | 80+ | Sandy loam (alluvium) | 10YR 6/3 (pale brown) | Massive, single grain |

---

### 2.2 Physical Properties (Phase 1 Baseline)

#### **Texture & Particle Size Distribution**

**Sample Location:** Deployment Zone Center (Treatment Plot, 0–25 cm Ap horizon)

| **Fraction** | **Measured (%)** | **USDA Class** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sand (50–2000 µm)** | 42% | Loam | Moderate permeability; equipment trafficability good |
| **Silt (2–50 µm)** | 38% | Loam | Moisture retention adequate for weathering kinetics |
| **Clay (<2 µm)** | 20% | Loam | Cation exchange capacity enhanced; weathering proof detectable |
| **Texture Class** | Loam | — | Ideal for pasture + ERW |

**Baseline Evaluation:** Baldock loam texture supports both rapid water infiltration (required for basalt contact) and sufficient retention time for weathering reactions (~10-year half-life on 20% clay).

---

#### **Bulk Density & Porosity**

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Method** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bulk Density (Ap)** | 1.32 g/cm³ | Core sampling (0–25 cm) | Moderate compaction; suitable for root penetration & water flow |
| **Particle Density** | 2.65 g/cm³ | Pycnometry | Standard mineral soil |
| **Total Porosity** | 50.2% | Calculated | High; supports lysimeter drainage & capillary rise |
| **Water-Filled Porosity** | ~35% (field capacity) | Field measurement | Optimal for aerobic weathering & root uptake |
| **Air-Filled Porosity** | ~15% | Calculated | Supports aerobic microbial activity |

**Baseline Evaluation:** Porosity supports both water availability (weathering kinetics) and oxygen diffusion (microbial & chemical weathering pathways).

---

#### **Water Retention Curve (pF Analysis)**

| **Matric Potential** | **Water Content (%)** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Saturation (0 kPa)** | 50.2% | Field after irrigation |
| **Field Capacity (−33 kPa)** | 28.5% | Usable water for plants + weathering |
| **Wilting Point (−1500 kPa)** | 14.2% | Plant unavailable water |
| **Plant Available Water (PAW)** | 14.3% | Alfalfa + ERW substrate support |
| **Air Entry Value** | −5 to −10 kPa | Indicates stable aggregate structure |

**Baseline Evaluation:** PAW of 14.3% is adequate for irrigated pasture baseline and supports porewater exchange for weathering quantification.

---

### 2.3 Chemical Properties (Phase 1 Baseline)

#### **Soil pH & Acid-Base Status**

**Sample Locations:** 3 plots across deployment zone (north, center, south); 0–25 cm Ap horizon

| **Plot** | **pH (H₂O)** | **pH (CaCl₂)** | **pH Buffer Index (BpH)** | **Lime Requirement Est.** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **North (Control adjacent)** | 5.98 | 5.41 | −0.57 | None (adequate) |
| **Center (Treatment core)** | 6.05 | 5.48 | −0.57 | None (adequate) |
| **South (Treatment margin)** | 6.12 | 5.54 | −0.58 | None (adequate) |
| **Mean (Baseline)** | **6.05** | **5.48** | **−0.57** | **None** |

**Variable-Rate pH Zoning (ERW Deployment):**
- **North sector (pH 5.98):** Basalt rate = 11 t/acre (slight boost for lower pH)
- **Center & South (pH 6.05–6.12):** Basalt rate = 10 t/acre (standard)
- **Rationale:** Higher-silicate basalt (0.3 tCO₂/t) provides targeted pH buffering; variable rate optimizes weathering driver (water + acid sites).

**Target Endpoint (Year 3, post-ERW):** pH (H₂O) = **6.8–7.2** (expected change: +0.75 to +1.15 units).

---

#### **Electrical Conductivity (Salinity)**

| **Parameter** | **Measured (dS/m)** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **EC (saturated paste extract)** | 0.42 | Non-saline; excellent for productivity |
| **Soluble Na** | 28 mg/kg | Sodium hazard: None; SAR < 3 |
| **Soluble K** | 45 mg/kg | Adequate potassium; no deficiency |
| **Soluble Ca + Mg** | 156 mg/kg | Balanced divalent cations |
| **Soluble Cl** | 18 mg/kg | Irrigation water quality: Excellent |

**Baseline Evaluation:** Low EC & balanced cation profile support clean baseline without salt-stress confounds; irrigation water is low-salinity (mains from Morrow Reservoir).

---

#### **Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) & Base Saturation**

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Method** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CEC (NH₄OAc @ pH 7)** | 16.8 meq/100g | Neutral salt extraction | Moderate; typical for loam with ~20% clay |
| **Exchangeable Ca²⁺** | 10.2 meq/100g | Atomic absorption | Major exchangeable cation |
| **Exchangeable Mg²⁺** | 3.4 meq/100g | Atomic absorption | Adequate for plant nutrition |
| **Exchangeable K⁺** | 0.42 meq/100g | Flame photometry | Low (pasture management); no deficiency stress |
| **Exchangeable Na⁺** | 0.18 meq/100g | Flame photometry | Minimal; no sodicity concern |
| **Exchangeable Al³⁺ + H⁺** | 2.66 meq/100g | pH-differential | Aluminum saturation = 15.8% (non-toxic) |
| **Base Saturation (BS)** | **83.2%** | (Exchangeable bases / CEC) × 100 | Excellent for agriculture |

**ERW Relevance:**
- **High BS (83%)** = strong baseline for detecting weathering-induced pH & cation changes
- **Target Year 3:** CEC saturation +5–10% (→ BS = 88–93%) due to basalt-sourced alkalinity
- **Cation depletion vector:** Alfalfa removes ~150 kg Ca/ha·year; measurable against baseline (10.2 → 9.0 meq/100g expected without ERW; with ERW → 10.5–11.0 maintained)

### 2.4 Organic Matter & Microbial Activity

#### **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) & Nitrogen**

| **Parameter** | **Measured** | **USDA Rating** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Organic Matter (loss-on-ignition)** | 2.8% | Moderate | Typical for semi-arid, managed pasture |
| **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)** | 1.64% | Moderate | ~29 tonnes C/hectare (0–25 cm) |
| **Total Nitrogen (Kjeldahl)** | 0.168% | Moderate | C:N ratio = 9.8:1 (good for microbial activity) |
| **Ammonium-N (NH₄-N)** | 8.2 mg/kg | — | Available N baseline (post-winter) |
| **Nitrate-N (NO₃-N)** | 12.4 mg/kg | Moderate | Typical for irrigated pasture (manure/urine cycling) |
| **Potentially Mineralizable N** | 85 mg/kg | Moderate | ~18 kg N/ha potential annual release |

**Weathering Implication:**
- **Adequate SOC** = fungal & bacterial populations support organic acid production → drives basalt dissolution
- **C:N ratio of ~10** = optimal for heterotrophic respiration (CO₂ production) within rhizosphere
- **Baseline NO₃** = confirms active N cycling; Year 1 monitoring will track whether basalt pH buffering reduces nitrification rate (minor expected effect)

---

#### **Microbial Biomass & Enzyme Activity**

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Method** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Microbial Biomass C** | 285 mg C/kg | Chloroform fumigation-incubation | Active microbial community |
| **Microbial Biomass N** | 38 mg N/kg | Parallel N extraction | Balanced bacteria:fungi ratio (~4:1) |
| **Microbial Quotient (qMic)** | 1.74% | (Biomass C / SOC) × 100 | Healthy; typical for managed soil (1–3%) |
| **Acid Phosphatase Activity** | 0.52 µmol pNP/g/min | Colorimetric (p-nitrophenol) | Moderate P cycling; fungal dominance (expected) |
| **Dehydrogenase Activity** | 18.3 µmol TPF/g/24h | Triphenylformazan reduction | Excellent aerobic respiration capacity |
| **β-Glucosidase Activity** | 0.89 µmol pNP/g/min | Colorimetric | Strong cellulose decomposition; baseline for DOC production |

**ERW Significance:**
- **Dehydrogenase** baseline (18.3) = establishes respiratory CO₂ flux proxy; Year 1 re-sampling will detect whether basalt application increases respiration (likely ±5–10%)
- **Acid phosphatase** = fungal activity supports organic acid generation (weathering driver)
- **β-glucosidase** = cellulose turnover & DOC availability; enhanced DOC → stronger weathering kinetics

### 2.5 Macronutrient Status

#### **Available Phosphorus (Olsen, Bray-1)**

| **Test** | **Value** | **USDA Rating** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Olsen P (sodium bicarbonate extractable)** | 18.5 mg/kg | Moderate | Adequate for alfalfa; no deficiency |
| **Bray-1 P (HCl + NH₄F extractable)** | 22.1 mg/kg | Moderate | Confirms moderate sorption; plant-available |
| **P Sorption Index (PSI)** | 24.5% | — | Low to moderate P fixation; responsive to P amendments |

**Baseline Value:** Moderate P status allows measurement of whether basalt-enhanced weathering mobilizes lattice-bound P (expected small effect, <2 mg/kg Year 1; stronger in Years 2–3 as pH rises).

---

#### **Exchangeable Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium**

| **Nutrient** | **Extracted (meq/100g)** | **Field Rating** | **Alfalfa Suitability** |
|---|---|---|---|

| **Mg (exchangeable)** | 3.4 | Adequate | Supports alfalfa yield; no Mg deficiency risk |
| **Ca (exchangeable)** | 10.2 | Adequate–High | Excellent for alfalfa growth & legume nodulation |
| **Ca:Mg Ratio** | 3.0 | Optimal | Ideal for forage quality |
| **K:Mg Ratio** | 0.124 | Adequate | Prevents Mg-K luxury consumption |

**ERW Impact Expectation:** Basalt weathering adds negligible K (basalt ~2% K₂O); maintains Ca:Mg balance; measurable Ca enhancement expected (10.2 → 10.8–11.2 meq/100g Year 2–3).

---

### 2.6 Micronutrient Status

#### **DTPA-Extractable Micronutrients**

| **Element** | **Value (mg/kg)** | **Rating** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Zn (DTPA)** | 0.84 | Marginal | Low for alfalfa; potential response to seed treatment |
| **Fe (DTPA)** | 4.2 | Adequate | No iron chlorosis risk (pH 6.05 neutral) |
| **Mn (DTPA)** | 8.6 | Adequate | Supports nodule function & manganese enzyme systems |
| **Cu (DTPA)** | 0.38 | Adequate | Respirable & nitrite reductase function normal |
| **B (hot water extract)** | 0.52 mg/kg | Marginal–Adequate | Boron at critical level; monitoring recommended |

**Baseline Note:** Zn & B marginal but not deficient; unlikely to confound weathering proof (no expected change post-ERW).

## SECTION 3: HYDROLOGIC BASELINE & WATER AVAILABILITY

### 3.1 Water Table & Drainage Regime

#### **Water Table Monitoring Network**

**Piezometer Installation (Phase 1):**
- **Location 1 (North, control-adjacent):** Depth to water table = **4.8 m** (February 2026 measurement)
- **Location 2 (Center, treatment core):** Depth to water table = **5.2 m** (February 2026 measurement)
- **Location 3 (South, treatment margin):** Depth to water table = **5.0 m** (February 2026 measurement)

**Mean Depth to Water Table (Baseline):** **5.0 m**  
**Seasonal Range (Est. from regional data):** 3.5–5.5 m (highest spring, lowest late summer)

#### **Drainage Classification**

|---|---|
| **USDA Drainage Class** | Well-drained |
| **Permeability (saturated)** | Moderate (1–4 cm/hour in Bw horizon) |
| **Seasonal Water Table** | Below 100 cm (plow layer never saturated under irrigation) |
| **Capillary Rise Potential** | Moderate (loam texture = ~30–50 cm rise) |

**ERW Implication:** Water reaches soil profile via:
1. **Direct infiltration** from rainfall (8–10 in/yr, semi-arid)
2. **Irrigation** (spring/summer: alfalfa demand = ~25–30 in/yr equivalent)
3. **Capillary rise** from 5.0 m water table (nominal 30–40 cm, supports root-zone weathering)
4. **Result:** Sustained water-rock contact in basalt application zone; favorable kinetics.

|---|---|---|---|
| **pH (field)** | 6.85 | — | Neutral, slightly acidic (reflects soil pH 6.05 + organic acids) |
| **pH (lab, after equilibration)** | 6.78 | — | Stable; minimal CO₂ loss during storage |
| **Total Alkalinity (titration)** | 1.84 | meq/L | Moderate; primarily HCO₃⁻ (soil CaCO₃ from parent material) |
| **Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)** | 0.018 | mol/L | Baseline (~0.018); post-ERW target = 0.045–0.060 mol/L |

| **NH₄⁺** | 0.21 | 0.012 | Low (nitrified rapidly) |
| **Total Cations** | — | 3.66 | meq/L |

**ERW Impact Expectation (Year 2):**
- **Ca²⁺:** 42.1 → 65–75 mg/L (weathering-derived silicate dissolution)
- **Mg²⁺:** 8.4 → 12–15 mg/L (paired with Ca from olivine/pyroxene phases in basalt)
- **Total cations:** 3.66 → 5.2–5.8 meq/L

---

##### **Major Anions (Ion Chromatography)**

| **Anion** | **Conc. (mg/L)** | **Conc. (meq/L)** | **Baseline Significance** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HCO₃⁻ (calc. from alk.)** | 112.4 | 1.84 | Weathering product; quantifies DIC |

| **PO₄³⁻ (total P)** | 0.12 | 0.004 | Very low (immobile, sorbed) |
| **Total Anions** | — | 2.82 | meq/L |

**Cation-Anion Balance:** (3.66 − 2.82) / 3.66 = **2.3% error** (acceptable; <5%)

---

##### **Silica & Trace Weathering Markers**

| **Element** | **Conc. (mg/L)** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Si (ICP-MS, total dissolved silica)** | 8.4 | Background silica from soil weathering |

| **Fe (dissolved, ICP-MS)** | 0.018 | Ultra-low (Fe(OH)₃ controlling; no ferrolysis) |
| **Mn (dissolved, ICP-MS)** | 0.24 | Moderate; reducing micro-zones in soil |
| **Ti (ICP-MS, immobile tracer)** | <0.001 | Baseline below detection; post-spreading = anchor |

**Post-Basalt Tracer & Silica Expectations (Day 0, post-spreading):**
- **Si:** 8.4 → 15–22 mg/L (basalt silicate input)
- **Ti:** <0.001 → 0.2–0.8 mg/L (titanium "immobile marker" spike confirms application)
- **Ca + Mg:** 50.5 → 80–100 mg/L (primary weathering product signature)

---

### 3.3 Soil Moisture & Irrigation Baseline

#### **Soil Moisture Monitoring (TDR/Capacitive Sensors)**

**Sensor Network (Phase 1):**
- **8 sensors across deployment zone** at 15 cm & 50 cm depths
- **Logging Frequency:** Hourly (1-year baseline = 8,760 measurements per depth per location)
- **Baseline Collection Period:** January 2026 – December 2026

**Representative Moisture Profile (Jan 29, 2026):**

| **Date** | **Depth (cm)** | **VWC (%)** | **Matric Potential (kPa)** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jan 29** | 15 | 24.2 | −28 | Field capacity (post-winter irrigation planning) |
| **Jan 29** | 50 | 22.8 | −35 | Drying from spring (alfalfa dormant; minimal uptake) |
| **Jun 15 (projected)** | 15 | 18.5 | −65 | Active alfalfa growth; irrigation demand peak |
| **Jun 15 (projected)** | 50 | 16.2 | −95 | Drying near permanent wilting point; capillary rise active |
| **Oct 1 (projected)** | 15 | 21.4 | −45 | Post-harvest; reduced transpiration |
| **Oct 1 (projected)** | 50 | 20.1 | −55 | Gradual recharge (fall rains begin) |

**Irrigation Schedule (Historical, from Pearson Farms records):**
- **Season:** April–September (6 months peak demand)
- **Application:** ~2 in/week (alfalfa requirement)
- **Method:** Wheel-line pivot or gravity flood (to be confirmed)
- **Total Annual:** ~24–30 in (plus rainfall 8–10 in = ~32–40 in equivalent)

**ERW Hydrology Impact (Year 1 expectation):**
- No change to irrigation schedule or infiltration (basalt fine fraction <150 µm mixes with topsoil)
- Slightly enhanced water retention in treatment zone (basalt + humic acid complexation) → +1–2% VWC at wilting point
- Lysimeter sampling will quantify porewater pH evolution under managed irrigation

## SECTION 4: LAND USE HISTORY & BASELINE CROP PRODUCTIVITY

### 4.1 Agricultural History (Documented from Pearson Farms Records)

**Parcel Management Timeline:**
- **2015–2025:** Continuous alfalfa cultivation (9+ years) with rotational harvest
- **Irrigation:** Spring-applied (April irrigation startup); season-total = 24–30 in
- **Harvest Cycles:** 3–4 cuttings/year (spring, early summer, mid-summer, sometimes fall)
- **Manure Input:** Livestock grazed on aftermath (post-cut residue); estimated ~5–8 tonnes fresh manure/acre/year
- **Fertilizer:** Minimal P/K supplementation (legume nodulation adequate); no N applied
- **Pest Management:** Routine (no recent broadacre herbicide use; compatible with baseline)
- **Rotation:** Alfalfa monoculture (typical for semi-arid irrigated systems; no in-field rotation)

**Baseline Productivity (Documented Yields):**

| **Year** | **Harvest 1 (spring, green growth)** | **Harvest 2 (early summer)** | **Harvest 3 (mid-summer)** | **Harvest 4 (optional fall)** | **Total/Year (tDM/acre)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2022** | 0.95 | 1.18 | 1.05 | 0.32 (minimal) | 3.5 |
| **2023** | 1.02 | 1.22 | 1.12 | 0.28 | 3.64 |
| **2024** | 0.98 | 1.15 | 1.08 | 0.35 | 3.56 |
| **2025** | 1.04 | 1.20 | 1.10 | 0.31 | 3.65 |
| **Mean (2022–2025)** | **1.00** | **1.19** | **1.09** | **0.31** | **3.59 tDM/acre/yr** |

**Cation Export (Baseline, estimated from literature for alfalfa):**
- **Ca removal:** ~150 kg/ha/yr (alfalfa biomass Ca concentration = 1.8% dry matter)
- **Mg removal:** ~40 kg/ha/yr
- **K removal:** ~180 kg/ha/yr
- **Total base cation export:** ~370 kg/ha/yr (~0.9 meq/100g/yr equivalent to soil CEC)

**Baseline Interpretation:** 3.6 tDM/acre harvest is consistent with 83% base saturation (good nodulation, no N deficiency). Post-ERW, yield may increase slightly (+5–10%) due to improved pH & cation status.

---

### 4.2 Crop Production Model for CO₂ Quantification

**Cation Depletion Tracking (Phase 3, Year 1 Harvest Protocol):**

1. **Harvest 1 (Spring 2026, post-basalt baseline):** Collect biomass samples; measure dry matter & mineral content
2. **Annual Total:** Sum 4 harvests; calculate cation removal
3. **Comparison:** 
   - **Expected (no ERW):** Ca removal = 150 kg/ha (baseline extrapolation)
   - **Observed (post-ERW):** Ca removal = 140–145 kg/ha (slight reduction due to enhanced Ca availability limiting uptake luxury)
   - **Net Weathering CO₂ Effect:** Difference deducted from gross removal (~10–15 kg Ca difference = ~2–3 kg CO₂ equivalent deduction/ha over 3 years)

## SECTION 5: ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### 5.1 Heavy Metals & Trace Contaminants (Phase 1 Baseline)

#### **Soil Total Heavy Metal Content (Aqua Regia Digest)**

| **Element** | **Conc. (mg/kg)** | **Idaho Background (typical)** | **EPA Soil Screening Level** | **Status** |

| **Cd (Cadmium)** | 0.18 | 0.1–0.3 | 0.7 (residential) | ✅ Acceptable |
| **As (Arsenic)** | 5.2 | 3–10 | 0.39 (residential, direct contact) | ⚠️ Background elevated; baseline acceptable |
| **Cr (Chromium, total)** | 28.5 | 20–50 | 100 (residential) | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Cu (Copper)** | 18.2 | 10–25 | 2960 (residential) | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Zn (Zinc)** | 42.1 | 30–80 | 23000 (residential) | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Ni (Nickel)** | 16.8 | 15–30 | 1600 (residential) | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Hg (Mercury)** | 0.08 | 0.05–0.15 | 0.31 (residential) | ✅ Acceptable |

**Baseline Interpretation:** All elements within EPA regional background & screening levels. No remediation required; post-ERW monitoring will verify no bioavailable metal mobilization from basalt weathering (basalt is relatively inert; low heavy metal content).

#### **Bioavailable Heavy Metals (DTPA/0.1M HCl Extraction)**

| **Element** | **DTPA-Extr. (mg/kg)** | **HCl-Extr. (mg/kg)** | **Bioavail. Fraction (%)** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pb** | 0.42 | 1.8 | 14.5% | Low mobility; no leaching risk |

## SECTION 7: TRACER DESIGN & POST-SPREADING CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL

### 7.1 Immobile Tracer: Titanium (Ti)

**Rationale:** Titanium is chemically inert, immobile in silicate soils (forms stable TiO₂/rutile), resistant to weathering, and uniquely identifiable via ICP-MS at baseline ultra-low levels (<0.001 mg/L in porewater; undetectable in pre-spread samples).

**Tracer Specification:**
- **Material:** Rutile (TiO₂) powder, particle size 150–250 µm (settles with basalt, does not leach)
- **Concentration in Basalt Batch:** 0.5% by weight (w/w)
- **Total Application:** 958 tonnes basalt × 0.005 = **~4.8 tonnes TiO₂ tracer per pilot**
- **Theoretical Ti Concentration in Soil (post-spreading):** ~9 mg Ti/kg in top 2 cm (assuming even distribution)

**Detection Pathway (Day 0, post-spreading, Jan–Feb 2026):**

| **Sampling Depth** | **Expected Ti (mg/kg)** | **Baseline Ti (mg/kg)** | **Tracer Spike (fold increase)** | **Confidence** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0–5 cm (immediate post-spread)** | 8.5–10.2 | <0.01 | **>850×** | ✅ Definitive |
| **5–10 cm (mixing zone)** | 3.2–5.1 | <0.01 | **>320×** | ✅ Definitive |
| **10–20 cm (sub-plow layer)** | 0.5–1.2 | <0.01 | **>50×** | ✅ Measurable |
| **Porewater (lysimeter, 25 cm)** | 0.2–0.8 | <0.001 | **>200×** | ✅ Definitive |

**Timeline:**
- **Day 0 (basalt spreading):** GPS + load cell record
- **Day 1 (Jan 31, 2026):** Soil sampling (0–5, 5–10, 10–20 cm) + lysimeter pull
- **Day 7 (Feb 6, 2026):** Repeat sampling (diffusion/redistribution assessment)
- **Day 30 (Feb 28, 2026):** Final Day 0 confirmation set
- **Analytical Method:** ICP-MS (detection limit <0.01 mg/kg; accuracy ±10%)

**Pass Criterion:** Ti spike >50× at 10–20 cm in ALL treatment plots (proves application coverage ±10% uniform).

---

### 7.2 Reactive Tracer: Strontium (Sr)

**Secondary tracer to track solute transport & dissolution kinetics.**

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|
| **Sr in Baseline Porewater** | 0.24 mg/L | Soil-sourced Sr isotope ratio (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ≈ 0.7065) |
| **Sr in Basalt Feedstock (typical)** | 0.8% by weight | Contributes radiogenic Sr (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ≈ 0.708) to porewater |
| **Expected Sr Mixing (porewater, Year 1)** | 0.35–0.45 mg/L | Increase detectable; isotope ratio shift measurable (Year 2 sampling) |
